      <title>Hacking Imposter Syndrome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I was in elementary school, I will never forget the feeling when my teacher said to a classroom of quiet, attentive students, “Girls shouldn’t be into technology. That’s a boy thing.” I left school that day with a myriad of emotions - mostly confused, and slightly irked. Was she right - that the fastest typer in class was not supposed to be in that field? That was my first proper taste of what it felt like to be an imposter. Little did I know, it would happen many more times after that - perhaps even more than I can count. Since then, I’ve learnt how to embrace the feeling of being an imposter and using it to my advantage - or in better terms, hacking it. I want to share some snippets of my journey with imposter syndrome - and hopefully give you some ideas that will help you find hacks that work for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

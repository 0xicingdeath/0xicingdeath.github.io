      <description>&lt;p&gt;70% of people have experienced imposter syndrome at least once in their lives. It’s this nagging feeling that we think someone else might find out that we’re a “fake,” that our achievements are solely due to luck and nothing to do with our talent, skill, or effort. Luckily in recent years, people have started to slowly become more vocal about the feelings of imposter syndrome - but there’s a lot more value is in sharing experiences and strategies (“hacks”) for dealing with it. During this talk, I’d like to share my hacks with you in hopes that you can use them, or use them to help you find what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

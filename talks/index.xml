      <title>Hacking Imposter Syndrome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;70% of people have experienced some form of imposter syndrome at least once in their lives. It is this nagging feeling that we think someone else might find out that we&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;lsquo;fake&amp;rsquo; - that our achievements are solely due to luck, and nothing to do with skill, talent, or our effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, in recent years, people have started to become more vocal about experiencing Imposter Syndrome - but I think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to be done. Being vocal is only the start. We need to start sharing experiences and strategies to deal with it. Otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I want to share my experiences and my strategies - or hacks that I used to deal with it. I hope to share it so you can use them or find out what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Happy International Womenâ€™s Day! Excited to end the day with an Introduction to Solidity talk at ETH U of T from 8-9pm!
The significance of this day has brought me to reflect on the progression of the past year. Days before starting my first coop, I remember admitting to Alic how I thought my skills were inadequate to be a blockchain developer. He told me to trust myself, and that Iâ€™m smarter than I think I am.</description>

      <description>After a few years of organizing McMaster&amp;rsquo;s annual DeltaHacks, super happy to be back as a speaker and mentor this coming weekend. I&amp;rsquo;ll be going into a Deep Dive of Blockchain, discussing how it works, its business use case, how to set up development environments, and live coding examples. I&amp;rsquo;m also epically excited to see the team again! Keep going guys - it&amp;rsquo;s the last stretch! ðŸŽ‰

<p>
Hello! I'm 0xicingdeath. I'm a blockchain security engineer with expertise in smart contract security, invariant development, and comprehensive security reviews. I specialize in helping protocols build robust security foundations through a combination of manual review, automated testing, and strategic guidance.
</p>

<p>
I am currently open to development opportunities, security review contracts, and engagements through Spearbit. During my four-year tenure at Trail of Bits, I advanced to the role of senior security engineer, where I led a team of two direct reports while conducting manual security reviews, fuzzing, and delivering conference presentations.
</p>

<p>
My expertise lies in <b>invariant identification</b>, development guidance, and comprehensive testing suite development. This technical foundation, combined with extensive manual review experience, has enabled me to bridge the gap between development and security research effectively. In my security reviews, I proactively assist clients in identifying invariants, which serves as a strategic foundation for manual review. This collaborative approach often leads to deeper codebase analysis and can uncover vulnerabilities during initial codebase discussions.

<h3>Technical Deep Dives</h3>
<p>As I used fuzzing in almost all of my engagements that were longer than 2 calendar weeks, I have years of experience with Ethereum-based fuzzers. In doing so, I helped found the "Fuzzing Workshop" streaming series, where we walked through fuzzing from the beginning, into more complicated systems. I ran streams for advanced defi invariants part 1 and part 2, which are outlined below. At the time, this was the first advanced fuzzing course of its nature, and continues to be an important resource for both developers and security reviewers to get started.</p>

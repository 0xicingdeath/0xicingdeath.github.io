<p>
Hello! I'm Nat. I'm a blockchain security engineer with expertise in smart contract security, invariant development, and comprehensive security reviews. I specialize in helping protocols build robust security foundations through a combination of manual review, automated testing, and strategic guidance.
</p>

<p>
I am currently open to development opportunities, security review contracts, and engagements through Spearbit. During my four-year tenure at Trail of Bits, I advanced to the role of senior security engineer, where I led a team of two direct reports while conducting manual security reviews and delivering conference presentations.
</p>

<p>
My expertise lies in <b>invariant identification</b>, development guidance, and comprehensive testing suite development. This technical foundation, combined with extensive manual review experience, has enabled me to bridge the gap between development and security research effectively. In my security reviews, I proactively assist clients in identifying invariants, which serves as a strategic foundation for manual review. This collaborative approach often leads to deeper codebase analysis and can uncover vulnerabilities during initial codebase discussions.
</p>

<h2>Technical Experience</h2>
<p>My extensive experience with smart contracts and ethereum has given me ample opportunity to understand defi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and scaling solutions. While much of my work is not public, I share public knowledge whenever possible. Some of my highlights can be found below:

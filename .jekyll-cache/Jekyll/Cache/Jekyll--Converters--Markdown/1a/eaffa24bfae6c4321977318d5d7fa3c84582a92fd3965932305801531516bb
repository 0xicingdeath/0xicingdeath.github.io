Hello! I'm Nat.
</p>

<p>
After 4 years of working as a blockchain security engineer at Trail of Bits, and 3 years of working as a blockchain engineer, I'm currently on hiatus, taking a step back from computers and technology. Once I'm back, I'll be ready to take on the world again!
</p>

<h2>Technical Experience</h2>
<p>My extensive experience with smart contracts and ethereum has given me ample opportunity to understand defi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and scaling solutions. While much of my work is not public, I share public knowledge whenever possible. Some of my highlights can be found below:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/04/30/curvance-invariants-unleashed/">Curvance Invariant Development blog post</a> – a highlight of the largest and longest solo fuzzing engagement with 219 invariants</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-03-curvance-invariant-development.pdf">Curvance Invariant Development report</a> – the full report containing details and findings of the 10 week invariant development engagement highlighted in the blog post above</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/primitivefinance/rmm-core/tree/main/contracts/crytic">Primitive Finance Invariant Development</a> – fuzzing different versions of the Primitive ecosystem during an engagement where manual review and fuzzing was conducted</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/crytic/solc-select">Author of solc-select</a> – a tool that allows users to quickly switch between Solidity compiler versions</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>In addition to learning new technologies, I am always passionate about sharing the knowledge I have gained over the years of reviewing code. The below highlight my public speaking engagements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Professor at George Brown College</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vETc-RXZoKA">Smart Contract Security: The Beta</a> – first talk to kick off the Defi Security Summit, talking about recommendations to writing safe code and embedding security into ones development process instead of as an afterthought</li>
</ul>

Hello! I'm Nat.
</p>

<p>
After 4 years of working as a blockchain security engineer at Trail of Bits, and 3 years of working as a blockchain engineer, I'm currently on hiatus, taking a step back from computers and technology. Once I'm back, I'll be ready to take on the world again!

<h2>Technical Experience</h2>
<p>My extensive experience with smart contracts and ethereum has given me ample opportunity to understand defi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and scaling solutions. While much of my work is not public, I share public knowledge whenever possible. Some of my highlights can be found below:
